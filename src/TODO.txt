++++++++   General   ++++++++
- Side margins are too large 
- Home page text shouldn't be same font as section titles
- No 'Donate To Us' (i think personally)
- overall website needs cooler color pallette
- overall needs better button response animations (lightups/hovers/colors)
- could probably find a funner font for <p> elements


++++++++   HOME   ++++++++
- Album cover shouldn't be a link 
- Text should read 'Bad Luck Party' with two buttons 'Listen' and 'Buy Album' 
- For big screens 
    - BLP cover photo on left, text on right. 
- For small screens
    - text below album cover


++++++++   NAV   ++++++++
- need cool animation for hamburger menu and X switch (see idles)
- phone screen 
    - nav should take up entire screen (see idles) 
    - Miss June at the top of nav 
    - socials links should be in header (not in popup nav screen)

++++++++   WATCH   ++++++++


++++++++   MERCH   ++++++++
- style each merch item (Font/spacing/etc.)
- for phone screen
    - only display 3(?) merch items (and have a "VIEW MORE" button that shows more merch)


++++++++   SHOWS   ++++++++
- I think the middleText should be left aligned 
- on smaller screens we should just 2 columns - all gig info on left, tickets button on right (instead of 3 columns)


++++++++   CONTACT   ++++++++
- fonts should be slightly larger
